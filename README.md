# TP_Synthese - ENSEA in the Shell

## Objective

The main objective of this practical work is to create a micro shell, used to launch commands and display information about their execution.

### Step 1 - Displaying a welcome message, followed by a simple prompt


### Step 2 - Execution of the entered command and return to the prompt


#### 2.a Reading the entered command.

#### 2.b Execution of a simple command (without arguments).

#### 2.c Returning to the prompt "enseash %" and waiting for the next command.

### Step 3 - Handling the shell exit with the "exit" command or "Ctrl+d"

### Step 4 - Displaying the return code (or signal) of the previous command in the prompt

### Step 5 - Measurement of the command execution time using the call clock_gettime

### Step 6 - Execution of a complex command (with arguments)

### Step 7 - Management of redirections to stdin and stdout with ’<’ and ’>’ 

### Step 8 - Management of pipe redirection with ‘|’

### Step 9 - Return to the prompt immediately with ‘&’ (execution of programs in the background)
